Status of the FITSWCS package
=============================

Origins
-------

This library was first developed by Raymond Plante in 1996 as part of
Project Horizon, a NASA cooperative agreement.  Version 2.4 was
released in 1996 under GPLv2 and made available to developers via the
NASA FITS Support Office (http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/).  This version was
compatible with Java 1.0.  

Development was discontinued after version 2.4.  In 2014, version 2.4
was uploaded to a GitHub repository (https://github.com/RayPlante/FITSWCS).
Developers welcome to submit issues and pull requests.

Current Status
--------------

Work is now underway to assess the overall state of the code,
including compliance with modern JVMs, compliance with current
versions of the FITS WCS standard, and any remaining bugs.  A modern
build and test system will be added.  

There is currently no schedule for this work.
